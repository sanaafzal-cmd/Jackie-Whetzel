                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    The town hall hosted in Greenville aired on Fox at 7 pm EST on Tuesday.
                    <br>

                    There were over 400 Trump supporters in attendance and many lined up at 4:30 am for a chance to see the former president.
                    <br>
                    
                    "Nikki has no chance," Trump told the crowd at the event.
                    <br>
                    
                    "You're not supposed to lose your home state and she's losing it big," Trump said, adding, "If she was doing well, I'd understand it."
                    <br>

                    The former president has been highly critical of Haley's campaign and has bashed her in his victory speeches after two caucus wins.
                    <br>

He continues to be the frontrunner for the Republican nomination and is projected to have a 77.7% hold on the vote, while Haley holds a much smaller 16.6%, per FiveThirtyEight.
<br>

Voting in South Carolina's Republican primary will take place in just four days, on February 24.
<br>

The Palmetto State doesn't have a formal party registration, so all registered voters can participate, regardless of whether their affiliation is Democrat, Republican, or Independent.
<br>

With Haley predicted to lose her home state, the New York Times has projected that Saturday's primary could be the last stand for her campaign.

However, Haley held her own event on Tuesday at Clemson University, about 33 miles from the Trump Town Hall, and announced she has no plans to drop out of the race.
<br>

"I refuse to quit," Haley defiantly told a much smaller crowd of about 50 supporters.
<br>

"I'm not going anywhere," the former South Carolina governor said, adding that she has serious concerns about another presidency under Trump or President Joe Biden.

            <h2>TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE?</h2>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    During Tuesday's Trump Town Hall, the former president confirmed six Republicans are on his shortlist for a potential running mate and vice president, including his former rivals Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy.
                    <br> 

US Senator Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) is also being considered, along with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Florida Republican Byron Donalds and former Democrat Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.
<br>

"All of those people are good," Trump said when Ingraham reeled off the list. 
<br>

"They're all solid."
<br>

He added that the one thing that surprises him "is that the VP choice always has no impact." 
<br> 

After Ingraham asked what qualities Trump would be looking for in a vice presidential candidate, he said it has to be someone who could also be a good president - and have common sense.
<br>

"A lot of people are talking about that gentleman right over there," Trump said, looking toward Scott, who was sitting near the front row at the town hall.
<br>

"He has been much better for me than he was for himself," he said.
<br>

"He's fantastic and a fantastic person."
<br>
Scott was in the running for the Republican nomination but announced in November that he was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race.
<br>
He had bashed Trump throughout his campaign but made a screeching U-turn to support him soon after calling it quits.
<br>
DeSantis and Ramaswamy, who pulled the plugs on their 2024 bids not long after, have also since got behind the former president - despite being staunch critics of his policies during their campaigns.
<br>

During the town hall, Trump said he believes voters are going to "swamp" the election.
<br>
He also condemned the US border crisis and claimed the country was much safer under his watch.
<br>
"There is no greater destruction than what is happening at our border," he said.
<br>
"We had the safest border we ever had."
                </p>
                <h2>BIDEN BLASTED</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    The Republican frontrunner went on to blast President Joe Biden for running with his declining health.
<br>
"He’s declined and there’s no question about it,” Trump said while adding that he wouldn't run if he felt diminished or was declining in any way.
<br>
"This guy is destroying our country," he added.
<br>
Trump said that he doesn't believe Biden will commit to a debate against him but still challenged the president to "as many" debates as necessary to win the election.
<br>
Ingraham asked Trump if he feels like a political prisoner due to all of the legal battles he's currently facing.
<br>
The former POTUS has been hit with 91 felony counts in four courts, as well as a civil suit and challenges that could disqualify him from the presidential ballot. 
<br>
“If I were losing in the polls they wouldn’t even be talking about me,” he said.
<br>
When asked if he's ever considered quitting and walking away from politics, Trump replied, "I can't.
<br>
"If I didn't run I wouldn't have any of these lawsuits."
                </p>

                <h2>SCOTT SPEAKS</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    At the end of the event, Scott spoke to the crowd on stage alongside Ingraham and Trump.
                    <br>
                    "Success breeds success," Scott said.
                    <br>
                    "Let’s fire Joe Biden and hire Donald Trump."
                    <br>
                    Scott has also criticized Haley for not dropping out of the race.
                    <br>
                    He recently told Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany that Haley "has to realize that this race is over."
                    <br>
                    “It’s desperation that you feel coming from her camp, and when you feel that type of desperation, that means the race is already over," Scott said.
                    <br>

                    Scott was in New Hampshire campaigning for Trump last month.
                    <br>

At the time, he encouraged voters on Instagram to pick the former POTUS writing, "Go vote Trump, New Hampshire!"
