                 <h2>IN A HURRY</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    It has now been revealed that Giddey was hit with two separate traffic violations in the Newport Beach area in July 2022, the Oklahoman reported.
<br>
Giddey would've been 19 at the time.
<br>
The Oklahoma City Thunder player has refused to comment after a series of videos went viral on social media accusing him of having a relationship with a female student at Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California.
</p>
<h2>'REFUSING TO COOPERATE'</h2>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The teen and her family are allegedly refusing to cooperate with authorities about the relationship, according to TMZ.

    "Law enforcement sources tell us police would obviously like to speak with the purported female and those close to her to gather more information regarding the social media claims that made rounds over the weekend ... but as of right now, no one is talking," the same outlet reported.

The legal age of consent in California is 18, while the age of consent in Oklahoma - where Giddey plays ball - is only 16.

In California, the offense is considered a misdemeanor if the accused and the minor are within three years of each other in age.

Otherwise, it's considered a misdemeanor or felony.
                </p>
               
            <h2>POLICE INVESTIGATION</h2>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    On Wednesday, the Newport Beach Police Department released a statement on the case.
<br>
Authorities said they intend to conduct a fair and thorough investigative process into the claims, while also maintaining the privacy and dignity of all parties involved.
<br>
"The Newport Beach Police Department is aware of information being circulated online involving an alleged relationship between professional basketball player Josh Giddey, and a female minor," the press release said.
<br>
"The Newport Beach Police Department is actively seeking additional information related to these allegations and pursuing all leads and evidence to obtain the facts of the case."
<br>
Authorities say the investigation is ongoing.
<br>
The NBA has opened its own investigation into the claims.
<br>
As of press time, the NBA has not imposed any sanctions on Giddey, and the guard continues to play for the Oklahoma City Thunder.
<br>
The NBA star was the sixth overall pick in the 2021 draft and was named to the All-Rookie second team during the 2021-2022 season
                </p>
                <h2>BOOED BY FANS</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    During Tuesday's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Giddey was booed relentlessly by fans.
<br>
                    He still managed to score 10 points and play 28 minutes during the matchup, which ultimately ended in a loss for his Oklahoma team.
                    <br>
                    When speaking during a press conference last week, the NBA baller was confronted about the accusations by the media.
                    <br>
                    He responded: "I mean, I understand the question, obviously, but no further comment right now.
                    <br>
                    "I get the question guys, I completely understand you guys want to know about it but just for right now, I don't have anything to say," he said.
                    <br>
                    Police have encouraged anyone with information on the case to call the Newport Beach Police Department at 949-644-3783.
                </p>
<h2>'RUN, HIDE, FIGHT'</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Around 11:45 am local time on Wednesday, police responded to UNLV, after receiving reports that shots were fired.

The university is situated 15 minutes away from the Las Vegas Strip and Mandalay Bay Resort Casino where the deadliest shooting in the United States occurred in 2017

Law enforcement quickly arrived on scene and evacuated everyone from the campus.

They sent out a text to students that said: "This is not a drill. Run, Hide, Fight."

Police located and shot and killed Polito about 45 minutes after the first 911 call was made.
