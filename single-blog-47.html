                <h2>LIVING NIGHTMARE</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    June, 44, posted the emotional update on her Instagram Story just hours before Anna's funeral in Georgia on Wednesday.
<br>
"This has been one of the toughest weeks of my life I wish all of this was a nightmare I could just wake up from n you b right here with us," the reality star wrote.
<br>
The From Hot to Not star included a photo of Anna clasping a necklace around her neck on her wedding day.
<br>
June invited the public to attend Anna's funeral services in Gordon, Georgia - which is about 100 miles from Atlanta - in a separate post to Instagram on Monday.
</p>

  <p>
    She said that Anna wouldn't want it any other way.
<br>
    Anna was diagnosed with adrenal carcinoma back in January after complaining of stomach pain.
    <br>
    She had been undergoing chemotherapy and had lost most of her hair before she died.
                </p>
               
            <h2>'EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER'</h2>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    
                    June revealed that her daughter's cancer was terminal back in July.
                    <br>
                    At the time, the family matriarch told Entertainment Tonight: "For me, it's an emotional rollercoaster sometimes."
<br>
"Mentally, it's always on my mind. We know it's terminal," she added.
<br>
She announced Anna's heartbreaking death on Instagram on December 9.
<br>
She wrote: "With the breaking heart, we are announcing that @annamarie35 is no longer with us. She passed away in my home last night peacefully at 11:12 PM.
<br>
"She gave one h*** of a fight for 10 months she passed away with her family around her like she won’t and we will be updating y’all with more information as we get it today.
<br>
"We love y’all and continued prayers and thoughts for our family doing this difficult time."
                </p>
                <h2>'OKAY TO GO'</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Anna's younger sister, Alana Thompson - also known as Honey Boo Boo - said in a post on Instagram that she was heartbroken over her Anna's death.
<br>
The former pageant queen wrote: "This is one post I wish I didn’t have to make.
<br>
"Last night we all surrounded Anna with love & let her know it was okay to go. Unfortunately around 11pm Anna took her last breathe.
<br>
"Anna was in so much pain last night but now as a family we all know she is at peace now."
<br>
Anna had two young daughters: Kaitlyn Elizabeth, 11, and Kylee Madison, 8, but previously revealed to The U.S. Sun that she experienced several miscarriages while trying to conceive a third child.

                <h2>HEARTBROKEN MAMA</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    In the wake of Anna's passing, her oldest daughter, Kaitlyn, has moved in with her heartbroken grandma June - whom she has a very close bond with, according to TMZ.
                    <br>

                    June has three other adult daughters: Lauryn (Pumpkin) Efird, 23, Jessica (Chubbs) Shannon, 27, and Alana (Honey Boo Boo), 18.
                    <br>
                    Anna's youngest child, Kylee, has gone to live with her biological father, Michael, per the same source.
<br>
                    June Shannon and various family members rose to fame after starring on several different reality stars over the years, including Toddler and Tiaras, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Mama June: From Not to Hot, and Mama June: Family Crisis.
<br>
Anna's final hours were filmed for Mama June: From Not to Hot, according to TMZ.
