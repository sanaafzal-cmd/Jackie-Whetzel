                  From photography to design, from news pages to editorials,
                  from videography to headline writing, from sports to news to
                  features to enterprise to advertising, The Register-Herald
                  newsroom, competing in the large circulation class, won 11
                  first-place awards and 31 overall in the West Virginia Press
                  Association annual journalism competition with the advertising
                  team winning five first-place awards and 19 overall. For the
                  fourth consecutive year, the Beckley newsroom took home second
                  place in General Excellence, with the Charleston Gazette-Mail
                  winning first. The Herald Dispatch of Huntington won third
                  place. The Beckley advertising team won third place in General
                  Excellence. “I’m so proud of this team and the work we put out
                  every day in an effort to help our customers with their
                  marketing. We faced so many obstacles last year, so being
                  recognized with this award is truly an honor,” commented Lisa
                  Stadelman, advertising sales manager for commercial printing.
                  Longtime local photographer Rick Barbero won Photo of the
                  Year.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, The Register-Herald’s sister
                  CNHI newspaper, was named Newspaper of the Year for the second
                  consecutive year by virtue of accumulating more points than
                  any other newspaper in both advertising and news contest
                  categories. Competing in Division 2, the Bluefield newsroom
                  also won first place in General Excellence. The Beckley
                  newsroom eclipsed its performance of the previous year when it
                  won seven first-place awards and 21 overall. “Despite the
                  myriad challenges of a pandemic, despite fewer journalists on
                  staff, this team just simply went about its business,” said J.
                  Damon Cain, Register-Herald editor. “I couldn’t be more
                  honored to rub elbows with each and every one of these
                  professionals. “Our haul and Bluefield’s performance clearly
                  say there’s noteworthy journalism being committed here in the
                  southern reaches of the state and we do a pretty good job of
                  holding our own,” Cain said. First-place winners came from
                  across the newsroom with Barbero winning both feature and news
                  photo categories. Jenny Harnish swept the best video
                  competition, winning first-, second- and third-place awards.
                  Harnish also won first place in best photo essay for her
                  pictures from a drive-through farmers’ market in Greenbrier
                  County.

                  Showing their dominance, Barbero and Harnish won 11 of 16
                  awards in photo and video categories. Jackie Wetzel, a
                  frequent freelancer for the newspaper, took home two
                  first-place awards, one in the news feature competition for a
                  story about the Meals on Wheels service in Wyoming County, and
                  the other for best governmental affairs reporting for a story
                  on water systems in Wyoming County. Jessica Farrish captured a
                  first place in best lifestyle feature for a story about the
                  complex nature of Black hairstyles. The presentation of that
                  story helped the newspaper staff win a first place in the best
                  lifestyle page competition. The staff was also credited with a
                  first-place win for its entry in best Covid coverage. Cain,
                  for the fourth time in five years, won best editorial and also
                  claimed a first place for best headline. First-place
                  advertising awards for Beckley came in Covid advertising, best
                  single black and white ad, best classified section, best
                  recruitment ad, and best theme pages in classified.
