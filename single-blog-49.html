                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Ethan was a sophomore at the Michigan high school, which is about 45 miles from Detroit, when he walked out of his school's bathroom and killed four students on November 30, 2021.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Before he was sentenced, Ethan stood and spoke directly to the judge.
                    <br>

                    "I am a really bad person, I've done some terrible things," said Ethan.
                    <br>
                    "I've hurt many people."
                    <br>
                    The school shooter said he wanted the victims' families to be happy with the sentencing outcome and apologized for what he did.
<br>
                    The judge then spoke, telling the courtroom the massacre is nobody's fault but Ethan's.
<br>
He said it was clear that the shooter wanted notoriety based on his pre-meditation and actions.
<br>
"The court cannot ignore the deep trauma the defendant caused," the judge said.
<br>
Tate Myre, 16, Hana St. Juliana 14, Madisyn Baldwin, 17, and Justin Shilling, 17, were killed, and seven others were injured during the massacre.
<br>
Survivors and victims' loved ones filled the courtroom on Friday to watch the killer's sentencing in person.
<br>
Many of them gave emotional impact statements.
<br>
Ethan, who was wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, kept his head down and looked at the table in front of him while they spoke.
</p>
<h2>LIVES TORN APART</h2>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Nicole Beausoleil, mother of 17-year-old Madisyn, was the first to speak.
<br>
    The girl's mom described the painful moments she experienced after learning her daughter was one of the students killed.
    <br>
    "Tears soaked the cold floor I laid on," she said.
    <br>
    Beausoleil shared how hard it was to identify her young daughter's lifeless body in the coroner's office and then tell her 11-year-old daughter that her older sister was killed.
    <br>
    She described seeing her daughter's body covered in blood and not being allowed to touch her.
    <br>
    She was dragged away screaming that day.
    <br>
    "I hope the screams keep you up at night and they cause real hallucinations,” she said to her daughter's killer.
    <br>
    "Those four walls become your home suffocating in guilt."
    <br>
    Tate's father, Buck Myre, told the judge: "Love is absent from our family because when you have no joy — you have no love.
    <br>
    "Me and my wife are trying to figure out how to save our marriage, which is really sad because we didn't do anything to each other."
    <br>
    Craig Schilling, father of 17-year-old Justin, also spoke during the sentencing.
    <br>
    Justin was found inside a bathroom stall after Ethan killed him.
    <br>
    "On that day, my life was torn apart," Craig said.
    <br>
    "There are no words that can actually describe the pain... This unfair reality is something I will never get over.
    <br>
    "I still find myself waiting up for him... it's unbearable to know that he's never going to walk through that door."  
    <br>
    Craig asked the judge to lock his son's shooter up for the rest of his life.
    <br>
    "My son doesn't get a second chance, and neither should he."
                </p>
               
            <h2>SURVIVOR SPEAKS</h2>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Riley Franz, a survivor who was shot during the massacre, told the judge her life will never be the same again.
<br>
"I mourn the person I used to be because, although I survived, the original pieces of me didn't," Riley said.
<br>
"Now when I sit at a school, I feel anxious checking for all my exits, highly in tune with all movements inside and outside the classroom, flinching at every sound from the walking upstairs to a pencil dropping, and counting down the minutes until I feel that I can breathe again.
<br>
"I cannot remember what it's like to feel safe and secure in any space that I occupy.
<br>
"I deserved to be a child that day, a student who made it to her class, not someone's target practice."
<br>
Avery Bluenstein, a 16-year-old junior at Oxford High School, asked Ethan to look at her multiple times while she gave her impact statement.
<br>
However, he continued looking down at the table in front of him and refused to make eye contact.
<br>
"I was certain I was about to be murdered," Avery said as she recalled sitting on the floor of her world history classroom during the shooting.
<br>
"I am now sentenced to a lifetime of PTSD. I have spent hundreds of hours in therapy offices," she said.
<br>
"Whatever punishment the shooter gets, it will not be enough."
<br>
She continued: "I will never have an ounce of forgiveness for you."
<br>
Several other people who spoke called the shooter a coward.
                </p>
                <h2>SECOND TRIAL LOOMS</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Ethan, who was 15 when he opened fire at the school, pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder, and 19 other charges last year.
<br>
He has admitted that he planned and carried out the rampage.
<br>
His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, are the first set of parents in America to be charged in a mass school shooting.
<br>
They will have separate trials in January 2024.
<br>
James and Jennifer are accused of ignoring their son's mental health issues and buying him a semi-automatic gun, which he used in the 2021 massacre.
<br>
They have both been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and have pleaded not guilty.
