                    The sheriff's office says Armstrong remained in deputies' eyesight the entire time.

                    She was then taken to Dell Seton Medical Center for treatment.

                    Armstrong is charged with killing Wilson, who was a rising cycling star, at a friend's house in Austin on May 11, 2022.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    She was found murdered with multiple 9-millimeter gunshot wounds.
                </p>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Police have said the murder happened after Armstrong learned about Wilson's affair with her ex-boyfriend, Colin Strickland, 35.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Wilson had a brief fling with Strickland while he was on a break from Armstrong, according to police.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Officials believe Armstrong tracked Wilson's location through her public account on the Strava fitness app, which is used by cyclists and runners to track and share their progress with others.
                </p>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Armstrong's 2012 black Jeep Grand Cherokee was captured stalking the street on a Ring doorbell that night.
                </p>
             
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Strickland walked his former lover back to the house at around 8.30pm the day she was killed, and Wilson's roommate found her lying on a bathroom floor covered in blood, per police.
                </p>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Strickland has previously told The U.S. Sun that his relationship with Wilson was strictly platonic after he got back together with Armstrong and that he felt law enforcement skewed the version of events told in the affidavit.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    "I had ended the relationship with Kaitlin and it was just interesting timing because Mo had come to Austin to visit a friend that exact week. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    "It was completely unplanned and yeah, we started spending some time together. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    "That was clearly expressed to Kaitlin at that time and Kaitlin dated other men directly after that. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    "We were clearly going our separate ways but we just didn't get enough inertia to separate.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    "Mo and I communicated about twice a month [after that] and I think it was skewed in a very misleading way in the affidavit," he said.
                </p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    After the murder, Armstrong deleted all of her social media accounts and fled to Costa Rica.
                </p>
               
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    She was questioned for the murder prior to fleeing but was not charged.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    When police issued a warrant for her several days later, she had already left the US.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    She was arrested on first-degree murder charges after over a month on the run.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    US Marshals in Costa Rica made the arrest at a hostel on June 29, 2022, before they handed her over to Texas police.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Court documents have revealed that Armstrong was believed to have traveled from her home in Texas to Newark, New Jersey, prior to using her sister's name and passport to go to Costa Rica.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    She reportedly got a nose job and cut off her hair after she fled.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Deputy US Marshal Brendan Filla commented that Armstrong had significantly changed her appearance, according to Velo News.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    A witness reported that she had two passports in a locker when they found her.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    They also found a plastic surgery receipt for $6,360 under the name of Alisson Paige, according to local NBC affiliate KXAN.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Armstrong's murder trial is scheduled to begin on October 30.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    The U.S. Sun has reached out to the Travis County Sheriff's Office for comment.
